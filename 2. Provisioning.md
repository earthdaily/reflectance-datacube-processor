# AWS Resource provisioning

## Manual setup

### Configure OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows your GitHub Actions workflows to access resources in Amazon Web Services (AWS), without needing to store the AWS credentials as long-lived GitHub secrets.

>❗Note: Support for custom claims for OIDC is unavailable in AWS.

#### Add identity provider to AWS IAM
To add the GitHub OIDC provider to IAM, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html).

 - For the provider URL, use `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
 - For the "Audience": use `sts.amazonaws.com` if you are using the official action.

#### Configure role and trust policy

To configure the role and trust in IAM, see the AWS documentation ["Configure AWS Credentials for GitHub Actions"](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#configure-aws-credentials-for-github-actions) and ["Configuring a role for GitHub OIDC identity provider"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create_GitHub)

Edit the trust policy, adding the `sub` field to the validation conditions and use `StringLike` with a wildcard operator (*) to allow any branch, pull request merge branch, or environment from the earthdaily/reflectance-datacube-processor organization and repository to assume a role in AWS. For example:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxx:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:earthdaily/reflectance-datacube-processor:*"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

>❗Note: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) recommends that users evaluate the IAM condition key, `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub`, in the trust policy of any role that trusts GitHub’s OIDC identity provider (IdP). Evaluating this condition key in the role trust policy limits which GitHub actions are able to assume the role.

### Create a container registry
First sign in to your AWS console and select Elastic Container Register and Create a new private repository.

>💡You can also use AWS CLI please see [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.html).

#### Create an ECS Cluster

Sign in to your AWS console and select Elastic Container Service and create a new Cluster.

An ECS cluster is a grouping of EC2 instances or AWS Fargate tasks on which we’ll deploy and run our containers. Pick the name you want and left the default settings.

#### Create a task definition

A task definition defines the containers and resources required for the application to run. 

In the container details section give a name to the container, then grab the URI of the image in ECR. 

The name given will be needed later in the GitHub Actions workflow so keep it in mind. 

Another important note is to give the correct ports (I used port 8000) that are required for the application.

#### Create a service 
Within ECS, start by navigating to the clusters tab in ECS and create a service using the task definition. For compute configuration, choose “Launch type” and leave the default option for Fargate. For the deployment configuration, choose “Service” and then, choose the task definition with the latest revision. Then, navigate to the Networking section and ensure public IP is chosen (You can modify this later if you have specific networking requirements). Finally, create the service.
