# AWS Resources provisioning

## Manual setup

### Configure OpenID Connect
OpenID Connect (OIDC) allows your GitHub Actions workflows to access resources in Amazon Web Services (AWS), without needing to store the AWS credentials as long-lived GitHub secrets.

>‚ùóNote: Support for custom claims for OIDC is unavailable in AWS.

#### Add identity provider to AWS IAM
To add the GitHub OIDC provider to IAM, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html).

 - For the provider URL, use `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
 - For the "Audience": use `sts.amazonaws.com` if you are using the official action.

#### Configure role and trust policy

To configure the role and trust in IAM, see the AWS documentation ["Configure AWS Credentials for GitHub Actions"](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#configure-aws-credentials-for-github-actions) and ["Configuring a role for GitHub OIDC identity provider"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create_GitHub)

Edit the trust policy, adding the `sub` field to the validation conditions and use `StringLike` with a wildcard operator (*) to allow any branch, pull request merge branch, or environment from the earthdaily/reflectance-datacube-processor organization and repository to assume a role in AWS. For example:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxx:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub": "repo:earthdaily/reflectance-datacube-processor:*"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

>‚ùóNote: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) recommends that users evaluate the IAM condition key, `token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub`, in the trust policy of any role that trusts GitHub‚Äôs OIDC identity provider (IdP). Evaluating this condition key in the role trust policy limits which GitHub actions are able to assume the role.

### Create a container registry
First sign in to your AWS console and select Elastic Container Register and Create a new private repository. 

Add image


>üí°You can also use AWS CLI please see [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/create-repository.html).

#### Load image to registry
Use the following steps to authenticate and push an image to your repository. For additional registry authentication methods, including the Amazon ECR credential helper, see [Registry Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/getting-started-cli.html).

    1 - Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
    Use the AWS CLI:

`aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 489065051964.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

>Note: If you receive an error using the AWS CLI, make sure that you have the latest version of the AWS CLI and Docker installed.

    2 - Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:

`docker build -t processordemo .`
    3 - After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

`docker tag processordemo:latest 489065051964.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/processordemo:latest`

    4 - Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

`docker push 489065051964.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/processordemo:latest`

You can also create a workflow that will build and push the image to your registry. In the codebase, create a .github/workflows folder, then create an aws_ECR.yml file. Keep in mind you can name this file whatever you‚Äôd like. Below is a workflow that builds a Docker image and pushes it to the newly created ECR registry. In the env section ensure to add the region and name of the ECR registry.

```yaml

name: Deploy to Amazon ECS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - deploy1

# AWS_REGION is the name of the AWS region that should be stored as Github repository secret 
# ECR_REPOSITORY is the name of your ECR repository that should be stored as Github repository secret 
# ECS_SERVICE is the name of your ECS Service that should be stored as Github repository secret 
# ECS_CLUSTER is the name of your ECS Cluster that should be stored as Github repository secret

        run: |
          # Build a docker container and
          # push it to ECR so that it can
          # be deployed to ECS.      
          docker build -t $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG .
          # docker tag $ECR_REPOSITORY:latest $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:latest
          docker push $ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG
          echo "image=$ECR_REGISTRY/$ECR_REPOSITORY:$IMAGE_TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```


#### Create an ECS Cluster

Sign in to your AWS console and select Elastic Container Service and create a new Cluster.

An ECS cluster is a grouping of EC2 instances or AWS Fargate tasks on which we‚Äôll deploy and run our containers. Pick the name you want and left the default settings.

Add image

#### Create a task definition

A task definition defines the containers and resources required for the application to run. 

In the container details section give a name to the container, then grab the URI of the image in ECR. 

The name given will be needed later in the GitHub Actions workflow so keep it in mind. 

Another important note is to give the correct ports (I used port 8000) that are required for the application.

#### Create a service 
Within ECS, start by navigating to the clusters tab in ECS and create a service using the task definition. For compute configuration, choose ‚ÄúLaunch type‚Äù and leave the default option for Fargate. For the deployment configuration, choose ‚ÄúService‚Äù and then, choose the task definition with the latest revision. Then, navigate to the Networking section and ensure public IP is chosen (You can modify this later if you have specific networking requirements). Finally, create the service.
